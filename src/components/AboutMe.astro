            His passion for programming, design, and all things tech began at a
            young age when he first got his hands on a PC at home. He fondly
            remembers the days of using Windows XP to play and write. His
            interest in technology deepened when he received his first OLPC
            laptop from school, which introduced him to the world of Linux and
            the powerful utility of the terminal. As he grew more proficient in
            coding, he explored the world of APIs and began developing his own
            using JavaScript (NodeJS) and frameworks like Laravel.
        </p>
        <p class="[&>img]:h-4 [&>img]:inline [&>p]:text-pretty">
            In addition to his programming skills, he also has experience with
            no-code programming, having created apps for Android using platforms
            like "<a
