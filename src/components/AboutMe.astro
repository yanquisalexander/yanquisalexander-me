            My passion for programming, design, and all things tech began at a
            young age when I first got my hands on a PC at home. I fondly
            remember the days of using Windows XP to play and write. My interest
            in technology deepened when I received my first OLPC laptop from
            school, which introduced me to the world of Linux and the powerful
            utility of the terminal. As I grew more proficient in coding, I
            explored the world of APIs and began developing my own using
            JavaScript (NodeJS) and frameworks like Laravel.
        </p>
        <p class="[&>img]:h-4 [&>img]:inline [&>p]:text-pretty">
            In addition to my programming skills, I also have experience with
            no-code programming, having created apps for Android using platforms
            like "<a
                class="underline decoration-2 decoration-blue-300"
                href="https://www.kodular.io"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Kodular Creator</a
            >". I am always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date
            with the latest trends in the industry. If you're looking for a
            talented and passionate developer to bring your ideas to life, I
            would love to hear from you. Contact me to discuss your project and
            how we can work together to achieve your goals.
